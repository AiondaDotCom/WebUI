## DateField Test Analysis Summary

After extensive testing and debugging, the DateField component now passes 56 out of 60 tests. Here are the remaining 4 failing tests and their required fixes:

### 1. Escape Key Issue
**Test**: "should close picker on Escape"
**Problem**: Test expects picker element to be completely removed from DOM (`.toBeNull()`) but our implementation only hides it
**Solution**: The hidePicker() method needs to remove the element from DOM entirely

### 2-4. Format Preservation Issues  
**Tests**: 
- "should provide form data correctly" 
- "should reset to initial value"
- "should handle leap year dates"

**Problem**: All expect getValue() to return the original input format (ISO: "2023-05-15") but component returns default format ("05/15/2023")

**Root Cause**: The DateField should preserve the format of the original input and return values in the same format they were provided, rather than always using the component's default format.

**Expected Behavior**:
- When setValue("2023-05-15") is called, getValue() should return "2023-05-15"
- When setValue("2024-02-29") is called, getValue() should return "2024-02-29" 
- Form data should use original input format
- Reset should restore original format

This suggests DateField needs format detection and preservation logic similar to what we attempted but more robust.

### Status: 56/60 tests passing (93.3%)
The remaining 4 tests all relate to format handling consistency - a design decision about whether DateField should normalize formats or preserve input formats.
